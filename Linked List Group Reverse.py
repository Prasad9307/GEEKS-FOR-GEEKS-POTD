Linked List Group Reverse
Given the head a linked list, the task is to reverse every k node in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then the left-out nodes in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed.

Examples:

Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8, k = 4
Output: 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5

Explanation: The first 4 elements 1, 2, 2, 4 are reversed first and then the next 4 elements 5, 6, 7, 8. Hence, the resultant linked list is 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5.
Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, k = 3
Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4

Explanation: The first 3 elements 1, 2, 3 are reversed first and then left out elements 4, 5 are reversed. Hence, the resultant linked list is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4.
Constraints:
1 <= size of linked list <= 105
1 <= data of nodes <= 106
1 <= k <= size of linked list

        tempHead=head
        n=0
        while curr:

            curr.next=prev
            prev=curr
            curr=temp
            n+=1
            if n%k==0 or curr==None:
                if tempTail:
                    tempTail.next=prev
                else:
                    head=prev
                prev=None
                tempTail=tempHead
                tempHead=curr
        return head
